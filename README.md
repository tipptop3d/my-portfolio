# TODO
- Analyze path -> split it into multiple bezier curves
- derivative of bezier curve -> angle
- calculate acceleration of ball based on angle (ball and mass differ on an incline: ball can roll if friction exist due to torque)
- calculate offset path distance regarding path an velocity of ball
- make ball draggable
